// 1) Start screen, instructions and start button 
// 2) Player hits start, game begins 
// 3) When game begins, 30 second timer starts to count down, question is displayed
// 4) While the timer is running the player may make a selection by clicking on one of the answers. If the timer runs out the question is marked as unanswered. 
// 5) When the player makes a selection the screen changes and displays accordingly "right" or "wrong." With an image that matches the correct answer. 
// 6) After five seconds of that screen we load another question and repeat the process. 
// 7) After the requisite amount of questions are answered we go to the end screen. 
// 8) The end screen displays the results: correct answers, incorrect and the unanswered. There's also a button to play again.
// 9) On the end screen our timer is stopped, the screen wont change unless the player clicks the "play again" button.
// 10) If the player clicks the "play again" button the game re-initializes, it DOES NOT reset.
